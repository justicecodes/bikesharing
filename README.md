# Citi Bike Data and Visualizations
## Objective: 
A data analyst is collecting information about bike rentals in NYC with the goal of creating a similar rental program in Des Moines, IA. The results will inform the new company on rental length, time of day, and users to target for the best sale probability and viability of starting service in another city.

- The busiest times are 8-9am and 5-6pm, likely due to the large percent of subscribers using the Citi Bike service for daily commutes

- The most common rental time is 4-6 hours
- Rental periods for male customers start decreasing at 5 hours, while female rentals continue to increase/remain constant until an 8 hour length. 

## Summary:
- The majority of users of CitiBike are male and subscribers. The most common checkout times are either less than 1 hour
#### Additional visualizations suggested:
- One visualization suggested to provide more insight is average checkout times by user type (subscriber or customer). This could provide the company more information to give incentives to riders who use the bike for either a very short amount of time or all day. 
- Another visualization that would help the company provide the best service to subscribers would be the top starting and ending locations for bike rides broken down by usertype. Then, add a filter to only view the peak times, 8am-9am and 5pm-6pm. This information can help optimize locations to establish bike hubs based on usage.
